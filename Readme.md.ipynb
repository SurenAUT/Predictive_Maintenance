    "# Chiller Failure Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project explores the prediction of chiller failures using machine learning models. The objective is to develop a data-driven approach to identify potential failures in advance, allowing for preventive maintenance and optimized system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** for failure prediction.\n",
    "- Extracted **feature importance** from input data.\n",
    "- Predicted **failure risk levels** based on confidence thresholds.\n",
    "- Visualized **failure probability over time** using time-series plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "- **Simulated Data:** Since real chiller failure data is often proprietary or unavailable, we generated simulated data reflecting different chiller performance conditions.\n",
    "- **Potential Real-World Data:** This approach can be extended to use data from IoT sensors, Building Management Systems (BMS), or OEM-provided datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenges\n",
    "- **Data Availability:** Real chiller failure data is limited, requiring simulation.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Identifying meaningful features for failure prediction.\n",
    "- **Model Generalization:** Ensuring the model can adapt to different chiller conditions.\n",
    "\n",
